                <h4> Description: </h4> For this project, Amina (my partner) and I collaborated on an interactive story which uses user feedback. We brainstormed many different projects but finally agreed upon our game called A Day In Your Life. We incorporated many different options and scenarios based on the users input. Our end project was a success and was funny, imaginative and interesting. Our feedback backs up this idea and was almost all positive.
                Our team dynamic was very effective ; we communicated easily and were able to compromise without undermining the other personâ€™s ideas.

                  <h4> Description: </h4> For this project,Catherine and I wanted to create a unique escape room idea. After brainstorming, we eventially came up with 'escape from Mr.Lees basement'. I We used our knowledge of coding in python and at the same time learned more about writing code through this project. While this project definitely impacted me for the better, there still were many obstacles. There were many bugs in the code we had to work out. Since both of us were relatively new to python, it was difficult to understand some topics and grasp some ideas. Once we continously asked questions and worked harder,though, We worked out our bugs and even made our code better. This project served as a gateway to what I am sure will be many more python projects.
